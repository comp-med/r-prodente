# `prodente`: **Pro**tein **De**terminants **En**richment **Tes**ting 

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `prodente` is to make results from the preprint [`Machine
learning-guided deconvolution of plasma protein
levels`](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.09.25320257) immediately accessible and
useful. This package contains functions to easily test a list of proteins for
enrichment of UK Biobank study characteristics.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `prodente` directly from GitHub:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(remotes)
install_github("comp-med/prodente")
```

## Getting Started

The API consists only of a hand-full of functions that mostly make working with
the results table more convenient. Each important results object is immediately
available as accessible data.

```{r}
library(prodente)

# There is example data provided
fasting_study_results <- prodente::fasting_study_results

# It is important to check that protein identifiers of your data are available
# in the background data.
check_protein_overlap(fasting_study_results$protein_id, return_missing = TRUE)

# Make sure to check the provided mapping table in case you have missing
# proteins. Maybe they are in the data but formatted slightly differently.
# Additionally, the table provides Olink IDs and UniProt IDs to make matching 
# easier
head(prodente::protein_mapping_table)
```

Enrichment tests can be stratified by sex or genetic ancestry. Set the
`test_across` parameter of the function `enrich_protein_characteristics()` to do
so.

```{r}
# Run enrichment tests for a list of proteins
results <- enrich_protein_characteristics(
  protein_foreground = fasting_study_results[group == "day_1", protein_id], 
  factor_minimum_explained_variance = 0, 
  test_across = "sex",
  n_cores = 8
  )


head(results[pval < 0.05 & or > 5, .(population, label)])
```

Enrichment tests can also be performed across several groups. Use the function
`enrichment_test_across_groups()` for this.

```{r}
# When data for several groups is available, supply a names list to this function
group_data <- list(
  day_1 = fasting_study_results[group == "day_1", protein_id],
  day_2 = fasting_study_results[group == "day_2", protein_id],
  day_3 = fasting_study_results[group == "day_3", protein_id],
  day_10 = fasting_study_results[group == "day_10", protein_id]
)

group_results <- enrichment_test_across_groups(
  protein_foreground_list = group_data, 
  test_across = "sex", 
  n_cores = 8
)

# You can plot enrichment results for a single subgroup (within either `sex` or `ancestry`)
enrichment_plot <- plot_enrichment_results(
  group_results,
  plot_population = "All"
)
```
